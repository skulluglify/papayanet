# information about all DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

- **MySQL**: MySQL uses the `?` character as a placeholder for parameter values in parameterized queries. When using the `database/sql` package with the `mysql` driver to execute parameterized queries against a MySQL database, you can use the `?` character as a placeholder for parameter values.

- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL uses the `$1`, `$2`, etc. syntax for placeholders in parameterized queries. When using the `database/sql` package with a PostgreSQL driver (such as `pq`) to execute parameterized queries against a PostgreSQL database, you can use the `$1`, `$2`, etc. syntax for placeholders.

- **SQLite**: SQLite uses several different placeholder syntaxes for parameterized queries, including the `?`, `?NNN`, `:AAA`, `@AAA`, and `$AAA` syntaxes (where `NNN` is an integer value and `AAA` is an alphanumeric identifier). When using the `database/sql` package with an SQLite driver (such as `mattn/go-sqlite3`) to execute parameterized queries against an SQLite database, you can use any of these placeholder syntaxes.

The process of wrapping string values and quoting identifiers in SQL statements is commonly referred to as "quoting" or "escaping." These terms refer to the practice of using special characters (such as single quotes, double quotes, or backticks) to indicate that certain parts of an SQL statement should be treated as string literals or identifiers.

Quoting is used to ensure that string values and identifiers are interpreted correctly by the database management system (DBMS) when an SQL statement is executed. It's particularly important when dealing with string values or identifiers that contain special characters or spaces, as these characters can cause issues if they're not properly quoted.


- **MySQL**: In MySQL, you can use single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`) to wrap string values in SQL statements. However, the use of double quotes for string values is only supported if the `ANSI_QUOTES` SQL mode is enabled. By default, MySQL uses single quotes for string values. To quote identifiers (such as table and column names) in MySQL, you can use backticks (````). For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT `my column` FROM `mytable` WHERE `mycolumn` = 'myvalue'
  ```

  In this example, the column and table names are wrapped in backticks, and the string value `'myvalue'` is wrapped in single quotes.

- **PostgreSQL**: In PostgreSQL, you can use single quotes (`''`) to wrap string values in SQL statements. To quote identifiers (such as table and column names), you can use double quotes (`""`). For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT "my column" FROM "mytable" WHERE "mycolumn" = 'myvalue'
  ```

  In this example, the column and table names are wrapped in double quotes, and the string value `'myvalue'` is wrapped in single quotes.

- **SQLite**: In SQLite, you can use single quotes (`''`) to wrap string values in SQL statements. To quote identifiers (such as table and column names), you can use double quotes (`""`) or backticks (````). For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT "my column" FROM "mytable" WHERE "mycolumn" = 'myvalue'
  ```

  In this example, the column and table names are wrapped in double quotes, and the string value `'myvalue'` is wrapped in single quotes.
